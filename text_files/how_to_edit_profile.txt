The editing is very simple.

You just go to your profile by clicking the profile button.

Inside the profile button you'll see a bar with your name in the middle. In the left side of it there are some cogs. Click on them and you'll reach the settings page.

After you've reached the settings page you can have your way. All information is inputed manually. You even have a color picker(the white box). You can click the color you want on it, and then copy the HEX code, or even the RGB code.

Remember, url's with dots in the image name are not accepted, for example: 
Valid: http://test.text.te/image.jpg
Not Valid: http://test.text.te/ima.ge.jpg
What you can do for it to become valid is downloading it and posting it to another site like imgur. And then it should work.

Play with it as much as you want and make the most wonderful profile in the history of... something.
