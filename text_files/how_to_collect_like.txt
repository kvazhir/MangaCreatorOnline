Very simple. You go to view manga, and hovering the mouse over a manga would make the collect buttons and the collect one to appear.

If you have collected it you will get a message in the bottom right corner. Liking it would update its status making the button green for like or red for dislike.


Entering on the page's manga would give you the like and the collect buttons under the manga's image.

The like buttons will update themselves automatically and the vote count will too. 

The add/remove button is for adding or removing a manga from colletions.


You can then visit your collection pressing on Favs. Again, on favs you can delete from collections or visit the manga page to comment or like/dislike.
